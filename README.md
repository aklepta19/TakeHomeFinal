Prompts from Assignment 24:
Issue 2: Modular Structure
Modules appear visually overwhelming. They are filled with instructions and assignments. In order to make it less overwhelming for students at a first glance, modules should be condensed, with a tab for PowerPoints, a tab for assignments, and a tab for any quizzes/ tests. Currently, having a separate tab for every assignment under a module makes the class appear heavy and overwhelming, affecting user design and experience.
For example, condescending the overview and syllabus module could be beneficial. Condensing every assignment in a module under one tab would also make the class seem less overwhelming.
Changing the modular structure would help with the Aesthetic and minimal design, as described as a heuristic to user design in page 377 of the Systems Analysis and Design textbook. 

Issue 4: Modules Layout
Currently, the modules layout does not allow you to see the current module you are working on. Instead, you must scroll from the top down in order to get to your module. By the end of the semester, you will be scrolling through many modules to get to your current one. This contrasts with the heuristics of  Flexibility and efficiency of use, visibility of system status, and help and documentation found in page 377 of the textbook. 
The modules sh0uld tab dynamically move the modules to the top so when module 2 is completed it goes “module 2, 1, …, n” and then continuously moves to have the most recent in the top (ending up in reverse order). By putting the modules in reverse order, we can better help our ease of use, make it easier to see what progress we have completed in the class (boosting morale), and helps us document what has been completed and what still needs to be done. 
Issue 5: Grade Weights Layout 
Assignments are weighted by group. On the “Grades” page, we are able to see which groups go into our final course grade. The layout view on this page lists assignments, tests, trash, and imported assignments. However, the syllabus lists that there are only two groups that impact our final grade. The two groups being three quizzes (40%) and exercises and B.A. project (60%). I think these two groups should be the only two groups reflected on the Canvas “Grades” page to make sure students understand exactly how their grades are calculated. Even at the bottom of the “Grades” page, imported assignments are listed as “N/A” because there are no assignments within that group. Trash is also listed as being zero percent of the grade but then there are somehow five points included in our grade in the trash group. 
According to Systems Analysis and Design by Spurrier and Topi, user interfaces should present information clearly and align with stakeholder needs. The Canvas “Grades” page includes irrelevant groups, creating confusion and violating the principles of clarity and data integrity. Displaying only the two relevant groups—quizzes (40%) and exercises/B.A. project (60%)—would reduce cognitive load, ensure consistency with the syllabus, and improve system usability.

Issue 6: Redundant links / adding tabs
The site has course videos, library resources, panorama, and zoom that are not utilized. Move the prerecorded Zooms (although it looks like there is only one video) to the Course Videos tab, as it provides clarity to pre recorded information versus the Zoom tab, which implies joining a Zoom instead of viewing videos. Going back for videos is also helpful for difficult concepts. Other teachers also have the Assignment tab active, which is easier to view versus going to grades or searching in the modules." This approach ties back to the principles discussed in Systems Analysis and Design in an Age of Options, where Spurrier and Topi emphasize the need for logical organization and system alignment with user expectations. Consolidating pre recorded videos under the "Course Videos" tab reduces confusion and supports easier navigation, adhering to the principle of minimizing user effort. Similarly, activating the Assignment tab streamlines access to key deliverables, aligning with the principle of improving task efficiency and usability. These changes make the system more intuitive, reducing the cognitive load for students.
Issue 7: Lack of a Files tab
Instead of grouping PowerPoints and other materials together in the modules, there should be a separate 'Files' tab or section specifically for lecture slides and resources. This way, students can quickly find what they need without scrolling through the modules. It keeps the modules focused on assignments and instructions, while all the extra materials are neatly stored in one place. Spurrier and Topi emphasize the importance of a clear system structure, ensuring that users can locate resources efficiently without unnecessary steps.

Issue 8: Mismatched Structure
Module 0 has a title for assignments so that they are distinguishable from the module instructions. This does not match the following modules, which have all modules and assignments together, without a clear distinction. This violates the consistency and standards heuristic, as the layout is not the same throughout the page.

Issue 9: Similar Modules are Separated
There is a redundancy in module 3A, as there are two separate sections for the same module. Since these are supposed to be the same module, each of these files should be located in the same place. This violates the consistency and standards heuristic as each of the other modules are all in one tab, except for 3A

Issue 10: Lack of External linkages
This class relies on many external sources for assignments (Visio, the Systems Analysis and Design Textbook, Citrix, etc.) However, there is not a module or file that is specified for links to outside resources. Especially towards the beginning of the class, it was difficult to find where / how to locate Visio, our desktop through Citrix, etc. Having an instructional or external resources tab can better help students figure out where to go and how to navigate the course.
